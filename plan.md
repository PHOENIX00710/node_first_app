# Plan Of action
- Make login, logout, register page
- Apply Basic Styling
- get and post request for all of them
- Authentication function using cookies
- Hash the password before storing it in database using bcrypt
- Rather than dealing directly with the id of mongoDb we can jwt(jsonwebtoken) 
- mongoDb operations will include create,find,findOne
